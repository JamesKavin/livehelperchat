In this folder you can create your own overides of templates
==

* In order to find out what template is used in one or anoher window. Enable debug output in settings/settings.ini.php
  * debug_output => true
* Template/Image/CSS is overrided by creating same path file in custom theme. So if you see that used template path is 
 * defaulttheme/tpl/lhchat/chat.tpl.php
* So you have to craete same file in
 * customtheme/tpl/lhchat/chat.tpl.php
* So same way you can overides original ones and create new templates.
