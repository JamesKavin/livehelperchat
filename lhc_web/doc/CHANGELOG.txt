If you decide to experiment with Long Polling make sure that.

Good luck with your experimenting.

Feature release:
1. An even smarter way to check for new messages. It will avoid a query to the messages table and first check that the user last message id is lower than the chat last message id.
It's better to add one query on each message add than to execute two queries each time.
2. Override CSS created in custom theme folders.
3. Different positions for main live helper widget.
4. Small other changes, some HTML cleanup, and debug output movement from main footer.
5. Number of transferred chats will be shown also in transfer tab.

Bugfix:
1. Close dialog, Close chat, Delete stopped working after I introduced new algorithm for checking messages.

Small release compared to previous one, but it does one amazing thing. Now all messages from user or operators will be checked with the same query. Last message ID algorithm was implemented.

Resume:
1. Removed status column from messages table, it's not needed anymore.
2. The same check messages algorithm for admin and user.
3. Only one index is needed now for the messages table. It improves write operations and eliminates update in user sync call.

Summary:
This release brings whole bunch of changes, most important is the performance ones. I have spent a lot of time optimizing every single query,
and limiting requests number to minimum.

Stability:
1. Now if a request fails, for whatever reason, APP will continue synchronization lists.
2. Within each page refresh there was a sound that a user joined the chat, etc. It's very annoying, and now this won't be happening.
